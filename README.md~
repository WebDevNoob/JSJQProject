# JSJQProject
Project to build a resizeable grid using Javascript and JQuery
Also uses interact.js to make each grid element resizeable and draggable
Has different modes toggled by buttons for mouse trail. 

It was a fun little project to build. I learned a lot about changing css on the dynamically.
Javascript is turning out to be rather fun!
